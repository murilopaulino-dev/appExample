# Project Example

This is just a project example that I've worked on for an interview.
On this project I created the RESTApi integration with the backend on firebase. I've created a couple of not so beautiful screens (since I'm not a designer, I'm not so good with creating creative sscreens) to implement the app's functionality (all the functionalities are describe in the 'Project Description' section of this README).
This project mainly focused on the logic and the code behind the scenes.
